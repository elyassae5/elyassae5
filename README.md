## About me

I enjoy building small but complete systems that automate real workflows.
Most of my work focuses on:
- AI-assisted automation (n8n, LLMs)
- API integrations and structured data flows
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems
- Backend services that connect tools together

I learn best by building, debugging, and iterating on real systems.

## Selected Projects

### 🔹 AI-assisted Email & Workflow Automation (n8n)
- Built multi-step automation workflows using Gmail triggers and APIs
- Used LLMs for classification, routing, and drafting responses
- Worked with JSON data flows, webhooks, and conditional logic

### 🔹 RAG-based Internal Chatbot
- Designed an end-to-end RAG pipeline (ingestion → embeddings → retrieval → response)
- Used FastAPI for backend APIs
- Worked with vector databases and caching (Redis)
